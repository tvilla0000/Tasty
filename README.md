### TEAM:
​
TASTY was a GA - Project 3 built in collaboration by students:

The goal of our project was to build a Full-stack Django Web Application while learning how to work as a team.
​
TASTY IS A FULL STACK DJANGO APP THAT:
​
* Persists data in Postgresql
* Authenticates Restaurant Owners using Django's built-in authentication.
* Allows only authorized users to create, update and delete their own resources.
* Utilizes a third-party API.
